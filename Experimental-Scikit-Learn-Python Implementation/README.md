For the experimental portion of the files (“SVMandRFC.py”), it must be ran from a WinPython command prompt. If there is not a WinPython command prompt installed on your computer, please install it from the following link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/
Once the WinPython command prompt has been installed on your computer, install the libraries for scikit-learn and NumPy using the command “pip install -U scikit-learn”. Take the python file and store it within the scripts folder under WinPython. After this task has been completed, open up the WinPython command prompt and type “python SVMandRFC.py”. The program will prompt you to enter either “SVC” for Support Vector Classifier or “RFC” for Random Forest Classifier. After providing the algorithm to the main program, it will prompt you to enter parameters which correspond to the algorithm selected.
