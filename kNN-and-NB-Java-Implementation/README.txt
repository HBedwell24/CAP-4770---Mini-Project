To run the first portion of the files ("kNN.java", "NaiveBayes.java", and "Word.java"), they may be ran by executing the test driver ("Classify.java") from the command prompt or from the console. If ran from the command prompt, first navigate to the workspace directory (which contains the java files) and compile the test driver by entering the command “javac classify.java” and then execute the classify.class file by entering “java classify”. The test driver will prompt you to enter either “knn” for kNN classifier or “NB” for Naïve Bayes classifier. After providing the algorithm to the main program, it will prompt you to enter parameters which correspond to the algorithm selected.
